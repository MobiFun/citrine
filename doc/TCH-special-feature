FreeCalypso Citrine firmware implements an optional special feature (needs to be
explicitly enabled at compile time) which we call TCH rerouting.  When this
feature is enabled, it applies the following special handling to GSM voice
traffic channels (TCH):

* All downlink TCH bits passing from the channel decoder to the vocoder block
  (260 bits every 20 ms; only FR and EFR codecs are supported) can be non-
  invasively intercepted and forwarded to the external host connected to the
  RVTMUX serial interface;

* Using the same serial interface, the external host can supply substitute
  uplink TCH bits which will be transmitted in the place of the built-in
  vocoder output, i.e., the latter can be effectively suppressed.

In order to use this feature, you need to compile our firmware in the voice+SMS
pseudo-modem configuration, i.e., the configuration in which the fw expects to
be controlled via AT commands wrapped in the RVTMUX binary packet serial
interface.  You can use a target GSM device that has just one accessible serial
port (Mot C1xx and Pirelli DP-L10) or one that has two Calypso UARTs (Openmoko
GTA02 or our future FCDEV3B), but in the latter case you will be using only one
UART - whichever one you have configured to be RVTMUX.

Whatever system you are building that will act as the source and sink for TCH
bits will need to interface to the FreeCalypso GSM device via a serial port in
the RVTMUX binary packet format.  Your system will need to send RVTMUX packets
with AT commands inside them in order to command the FC GSM device to register
with the network and to dial and/or answer calls, and you will need to send
RVTMUX packets of a different kind in order to supply the uplink TCH bits
during calls.  In the other direction, your system will receive responses to
the AT commands you send, asynchronous notifications of incoming calls and SMS,
downlink TCH bits and various debug trace output from our FreeCalypso firmware.
The last part (debug trace output) can be simply ignored and discarded if you
wish, but we strongly recommend that you provide a way to view and/or log it
for debugging purposes.

Please see the RVTMUX document in the FreeCalypso host tools package for general
background information regarding the RVTMUX binary packet interface; this
document should be considered required reading for anyone interested in working
with the TCH rerouting special feature.

All packets transferred over the RVTMUX interface begin and end with 0x02.  If
a payload byte within a packet equals 0x02 or 0x10, it needs to be prepended
with 0x10 as a transparency escape; all other payload bytes are sent literally.
The first byte within each RVTMUX packet after the opening 0x02 is the packet
type; the two packet types you will need to handle (both generate and receive)
are 0x1A for AT commands and 0x1C for TCH configuration commands.

To send an AT command to the FreeCalypso GSM device, prepend the 0x1A packet
type in front of the "AT" characters, wrap the packet with 0x02 bytes on both
ends, and send it to the modem.  Responses to AT commands and asynchronous
notification messages such as "RING" for incoming calls will be sent to the
host as RVTMUX packets also beginning with the 0x1A packet type; they will be
interspersed among other packet types, mostly debug trace output.  Your system
will need to receive the RVTMUX serial byte stream continuously, parsing the
packet structure and looking at the type of each packet (the first byte after
the opening 0x02) in order to detect if the modem has sent something you may be
interested in.

If you wish to receive a copy of all downlink TCH bits on the serial channel,
you will need to send the following 5-byte command packet to the modem:

0x02: opening flag
0x1C: RVTMUX packet type for TCH
0x11: TCH_CONFIG_REQ command opcode
0x01: payload byte indicating that the "forward downlink" state should be
	set to enabled
0x02: closing flag

The modem will respond with a TCH_CONFIG_CONF confirmation message (opcode
0x12), and then during all voice calls your external host will receive the
following packet every 20 ms:

0x02: opening flag
0x1C: RVTMUX packet type for TCH
0x15: TCH_DLBITS_IND opcode
- 40 (decimal) bytes of payload -
0x02: closing flag

The 40 bytes of payload sent in every TCH_DLBITS_IND packet directly correspond
to the 20 16-bit words provided by the Calypso DSP in its a_dd_0 buffer.  The
first 3 words (6 bytes) contain the DSP's own status information (not fully
understood by us yet, but we let you see what the DSP tells us without redacting
anything out), and the remaining 17 words (34 bytes) contain the TCH bits
received from the GSM network in the GSM 05.03 bit order - see TCH-bit-access
write-up in the FreeCalypso host tools package for more information.  Each DSP
API word is sent in the big-endian byte order, i.e., the most significant byte
followed by the least significant byte.

If you wish to send your own TCH uplink bits, replacing the output of the
built-in vocoder with your own alternate uplink data, you will need to send
your uplink TCH bits to the modem in packets of the following format:

0x02: opening flag
0x1C: RVTMUX packet type for TCH
0x13: TCH_ULBITS_REQ opcode
- 33 or 34 (decimal) bytes of payload -
0x02: closing flag

Sending 260 bits requires only 33 bytes, but the DSP operates in terms of
16-bit words, hence 17 of those words are used.  The least significant byte of
the last word (i.e., the very last byte with our big-endian transmission order)
is not expected to be used, but if you send 34 bytes rather than 33, you will
have control over every bit going into the DSP API RAM in this case.

There is a queue inside the firmware in which these TCH uplink data blocks are
stored; this queue is filled by the serial packet receiving handler and drained
by the L1S (synchronous) code that executes at the right times in the GSM TDMA
multiplex when uplink TCH transmission is expected.  Up to 4 blocks can be
queued up; as each queued-up block is transmitted on the air (more precisely,
as it is passed to the DSP for channel encoding and transmission), a
TCH_ULBITS_CONF short packet (consisting of just the opcode and nothing more)
is sent to the host.  These confirmation packets can be used to pace the sending
of further TCH_ULBITS_REQs.

Host side reference implementation
==================================

If you are going to implement your own system for talking to FreeCalypso GSM
pseudo-modems via the RVTMUX binary packet interface, we strongly recommend
that you use our rvinterf and fc-shell Unix/Linux host utilities as your
starting point.  You can find their source code in the freecalypso-tools Hg
repository on Bitbucket.
