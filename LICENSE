Notice of Adoption
==================

I, Mychaela Nadezhda Falconia, hereby appoint myself as the Adoptive Mother of
the GSM mobile station firmware code that has been abandoned, disowned and
discarded in the trash by Texas Instruments (TI).  I argue that by effectively
disowning this code and discarding it in the trash, TI have forfeited any and
all rights they may have had to this code, both moral and economic, and I ask
the users and distributors of my code to ignore and disregard any and all TI
copyright notices interspersed in various individual source files.

Declaration of Free Software Status
===================================

I, Mychaela Nadezhda Falconia, the Adoptive Mother of the software contained in
this source repository, develop, maintain and distribute this work with the
intention that it be treated as Free Software.  Specifically:

* By virtue of there being no one to stop you from doing so, you may use this
  code as you wish, for any purpose whatsoever;

* By virtue of the complete source code being published, you may study how this
  code works, and change it so it does whatever you desire;

* By virtue of there being no one to stop you from doing so, you may
  redistribute copies of this code however you like;

* Also by virtue of there being no one to stop you from doing so, you may
  distribute modified versions to others as well.

Because the present developer, maintainer and distributor of this code is me
and not TI, I argue that my granting of all of the above freedoms to the user
community should supercede the lack of such grant from TI, and that my work has
the right to be treated as Free Software.
