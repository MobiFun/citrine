# This configuration is intended for users of the TCH rerouting special feature
# (see ../../doc/TCH-special-feature) who are using Openmoko GTA02 as their
# platform.  This is the so-called "external" configuration in that the binary
# RVTMUX packet interface is routed to the external serial port on the headset
# jack while the internal serial channel connected to the GTA02 AP presents the
# classic ASCII AT command interface, meaning that:
#
# (a) more or less standard software can still be used on the GTA02 AP for
#     interfacing to the GSM modem, but only for the standard voice+SMS
#     functionality and not for exercising the TCH rerouting special feature;
#
# (b) the TCH rerouting special feature can be only be exercised by sending
#     special RVTMUX binary packets to the modem from an external system via
#     the headset jack serial channel, as explained in the TCH-special-feature
#     document.
