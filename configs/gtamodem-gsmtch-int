# This configuration is intended for users of the TCH rerouting special feature
# (see ../../doc/TCH-special-feature) who are using Openmoko GTA02 as their
# platform.  This is the so-called "internal" configuration in that the binary
# RVTMUX packet interface is routed to the internal serial port connected to
# the application processor, DISPLACING the classic ASCII AT command interface,
# meaning that:
#
# (a) standard GSM modem-interfacing software as found in QtMoko/SHR/etc CANNOT
#     be used, instead you have to write your own modem-interfacing software
#     that wraps all AT commands in RVTMUX packets and reads the output from
#     the modem in RVTMUX format;
#
# (b) the TCH rerouting special feature CAN be exercised from within the GTA02
#     itself, i.e., from the application processor, without needing an external
#     system connected to the headset jack serial port.
